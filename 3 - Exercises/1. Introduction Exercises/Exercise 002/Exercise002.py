Subset and conquer
Subsetting Python lists is a piece of cake.
Take the code sample below, which creates a list x and then selects "b" from it.
Remember that this is the second element, so it has index 1.
You can also use negative indexing.

Remember the areas list from before, containing both strings and floats?
Its definition is already in the script.
Can you add the correct code to do some Python subsetting?
'''
# Create the areas list
areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0, "living room", 20.0, "bedroom", 10.75, "bathroom", 9.50]

# Print out second element from areas
print(areas[_])

# Print out last element from areas
print(areas[_])

# Print out the area of the living room
print(areas[_])
