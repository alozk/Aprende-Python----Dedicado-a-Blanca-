List Methods
Strings are not the only Python types that have methods associated with them.
Lists, floats, integers and booleans are also types that come packaged with a bunch of useful methods.
In this exercise, you'll be experimenting with:

index(), to get the index of the first element of a list that matches its input and
count(), to get the number of times an element appears in a list.
You'll be working on the list with the area of different parts of a house: areas.

Instructions
Use the index() method to get the index of the element in areas that is equal to 20.0.
Print out this index.
Call count() on areas to find out how many times 9.50 appears in the list.
Again, simply print out this number.
'''
# Create list areas
areas = [11.25, 18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 9.50]

# Print out the index of the element 20.0


# Print out how often 9.50 appears in areas
